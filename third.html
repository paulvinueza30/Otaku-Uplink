            <h3>Awareness</h3>
            <p> Otaku Uplink plans to bring awareness to its business in its early stages through the use of local advertising, as well as social media. Additionally we hope to team up with local philanthropies as well to help promote our services in a way that gives back to the community. </p>
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>To give customers the opportunity to experience our business, we will be employing various sales on our services to entice new customers to come. Additionally, we will have various surveys and opportunities in which customers will be able to give their insight.</p>
            <h3>Purchases</h3>
            <p>Our channels for purchases can be split into two major compartments, Food & Beverages as well as Entertainment. 
              Food & Beverages Channels are expected to be fulfilled through our partnerships with Musuvi Inc. (our international snacks and beverages imported from Japan) as well as local food suppliers. These partnerships will allow us to provide an authentic experience for our customers.
            Entertainment Channels channels are expected to be fulfilled through our state of the art computer lounge, and manga library. These amenities will allow our guests to enjoy an experience above that of just an ordinary lounge.</p>
            <h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>
	After sales opportunities are an essential part of our customer relations as we hope to build a community with our patrons. Given the services we provide, our after sales channels are focused on rectifying any and all customer service issues. Our management is specifically trained in these issues, and are given the freedom and flexibility to solve them at their discretion. 
</p>
<h3>Customer Relations</h3>
<p>Customer relationships will be developed and focused once any customer makes first contact with the establishment, this is done through interactions with our employees. The employees we hire are trained enthusiasts of Japanese culture, they are to provide helpful information, or spark interesting conversations with patrons. Additionally, customer relations will be maintained after the patrons leave the premises through the use of social media connectivity via Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. All social media accounts will feature giveaways and various other incentives (such as 50 percent off of certain items) to those actively following. Not only 
  that we will have a website with a forum to inspire conversation between customers.
